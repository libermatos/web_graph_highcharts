web_graph_highcharts
====================

Module for generating graphical applications Highcharts in OpenERP 6.1-1

Summary
-------
	OpenERP is an open source system and platform for Enterprise Resource Planning. It has a mechanism
	for generating graphic by obtaining data from the database. This mechanism sometimes does not meet
	all possible graphics to be shown in the application. The chart types are primarily pie and bar,
	which does not allow interaction with users and visually are not very showy. web_graph_highcharts
	module provides another independent mechanism for generating graphics, which does not replace the
	existing but is responsible for establishing the relationship between the development framework
	OpenERP 6.1 and JavaScript framework Highcharts. Thus creating more colorful graphics, of various
	types, to provide more information and visual user interaction is achieved.
